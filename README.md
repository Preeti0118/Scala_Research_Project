# Scala_Research_Project

This is a research project on scala to understand the basics of scala programming language

Scala lets you write code in an object-oriented programming (OOP) style, a functional programming (FP) style, and even in a hybrid style, using both approaches in combination.

This project covers the basics of pure and impure fiunctions, some of the common syntaxes of scala and a sample code using dataframes in spark-scala.
